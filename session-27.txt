Ansible Roles
===============
Ansible role is property directory structure of creating, managing and reusing playbooks. we can breakdown playbooks into multiple components like tasks, handlers, vars, meta, templates, files, etc. by default ansible loads main.yaml in these directories

ansible configuration
================
1. ANSIBLE_CONFIG
2. PWD ansible.cfg
3. user home directory .ansible.cfg
4. /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg


Ansible roles Searching Locations:
==================================
/home/ec2-user/ansible-roboshop-roles/roles/mongodb/files/mongo.repo
/home/ec2-user/ansible-roboshop-roles/roles/mongodb/mongo.repo
/home/ec2-user/ansible-roboshop-roles/roles/mongodb/tasks/files/mongo.repo
/home/ec2-user/ansible-roboshop-roles/roles/mongodb/tasks/mongo.repo
/home/ec2-user/ansible-roboshop-roles/files/mongo.repo
/home/ec2-user/ansible-roboshop-roles/mongo.repo

For catalogue Setup:
nodejs_setup -> enable install nodejs install dependencies
app_setup -> create directory, create system user, download code, unarchieve code
system_setup

Created Common role for above activities
roles/common/tasks/main.yaml


The meta/main.yml file in an Ansible role is used to store metadata about the role and, most importantly, to declare its dependencies on other roles
roles/catalogue/meta/main.yaml  (00:56:40 Importance of this)



1. load catalogue role
2. ansible finds meta directory and main.yaml
3. it depends on common role
4. ansible executes main.yaml in common/tasks folder
5. now ansible starts executing catalogue/tasks/main.yaml
6. we extracted common code into common/app-setup.yaml
7. ansible imports this into catalogue/tasks/main


## Role directory structure from Ansible official Documentation (https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html)

roles/
    common/               # this hierarchy represents a "role"
        tasks/            #
            main.yml      #  <-- tasks file can include smaller files if warranted
        handlers/         #
            main.yml      #  <-- handlers file
        templates/        #  <-- files for use with the template resource
            ntp.conf.j2   #  <------- templates end in .j2
        files/            #
            bar.txt       #  <-- files for use with the copy resource
            foo.sh        #  <-- script files for use with the script resource
        vars/             #

        module_utils/     # roles can also include custom module_utils
        lookup_plugins/   # or other types of plugins, like lookup in this case

    webtier/              # same kind of structure as "common" was above, done for the webtier role
