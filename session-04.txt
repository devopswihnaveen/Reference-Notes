id <user-name>
cat /etc/passwd -> all users info
cat /etc/group -> display all the groups in server

A user in Linux will have only one primary group and atleast one secondary group

when you create user, group also will be created with same name

usermod -aG testing ramesh

passwd ramesh -> set the password

by default only key-based authentications are enabled
