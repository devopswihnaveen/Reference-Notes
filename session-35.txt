workspace -> terraform.workspace

terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace select dev

variables keys should be based on the env names


terraform init -reconfigure -backend-config=dev/backend.config
terraform plan -var-file=dev/dev.tfvars
terraform apply -auto-approve -var-file=dev/terraform.tfvars

CICD tools are useful to reduce human errors here

advantages
==========
code reuse

disadvantages
===========
mistakes can be taken into production
no isolation
blast radius is very high

you can create multiple repos for NON-PROD and PROD

disadvantages
=============
duplicate code

roboshop-infra-dev
roboshop-infra-prod

we can use modules feature to
- reuse
- enforce standards across projects
- central place to push the updates
- easy maintanance

module "name_of_module" {
	source = "git-repo"
}

name_of_module -> programs

name-of-module -> humans

resource "aws_instance" "catalogue" {


}

Human Ramesh

only one resource => this/main

main -> where program starts executing (main code is here)

list of sg_id -> sg_ids

1 resource -> singular
multiple/list -> plural name

VPC
====
Virtual private cloud is like a data center where can create resources to our project in an isolated space. it is completely in our control.

data center
network connection
subnets
servers

select one village
select one street
get one house number
then construct

subnets -> we create partitions in our network for maintanance and security. if not secure or end users connect directly then it is public subnet. if secure like backend or databases then it is private subnet.

arch -> internet gateway/modem

pincode -> CIDR 

IPV4 Address

32 bits binary system

unary -> 1, 11, 111, etc
binary -> 0 1 -> 2
decimal -> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 -> 10

168 -> face value and place value
8 -> 8*10^0 = 8
6 -> 6*10^1 = 60
1 -> 1*10^2 = 100

1	6	8

2	1	0

4 parts each part contains 8 bits(Octate)

32 bits = 2^32 = 4.29 billion IP address

NAT -> 1 -> private ip addresses inside network

IP = Network+Host

500082-20-30

10.0.0.0/16 -> 16 bits are reserved for network, 16 bits are reserved for host/server
2^16 = 65,536 IP address possible

10.0.0.0/24 -> 24 network bits, remaining 8 are allocated for host -> 2^8 -> 256 Ip address possible

192.168.1.0/24 -> 256 devices can be connected to your modem

192.168.1.0 -> modem
192.168.1.1
