handlers
=========
handlers are notifiers, you can call task-b when task-a changes. for example when a configuration changes you can restart the application using handlers.

tags
=====
if you want a specific tag to run inside playbook, tag it and call it

deployment
===========
1. remove old code
2. copy new code
3. install dependencies
4. restart the server

include_role vs import_rule
=======
way of calling other roles.

import_role respects the tags. if you apply tags to import_role those will be automatically applied to all the tasks inside that role...

include_role does not respect tags
