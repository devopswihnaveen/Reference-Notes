A 	 -> IPv4
AAAA -> IPv6
MX 	 -> Mail
NS	 -> Domain authority
CNAME -> Point to another domain

NoSQL
=======
data is un sctructured
useful when huge amounts of data
data is stored as documents
generally used for product catalouges, Real-time analytic, etc but not for transactions

Redis
=======
in-memory(RAM) database
in-memory(RAM) database
HD -> RAM -> Processor
key-value database
apps -> cache -> database

Asynchronous
===========
ActiveMQ, IBM MQ, RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc...

request and wait -> http
fire and forget  -> mail, whatsapp, etc..

Prodcuer -> Who is sending message
Consumer -> Who is consuming message

No waiting, good user experience
Scalability
Reliability
Loose Coupling
	Tight Coupling -> with on our system
Queue management -> FIFO

Pub/Sub -> 1 to many
Queue -> 1 to 1
Publisher -> Who is sending message
Subscriber -> Who is following

Generally databases by default not accept connections from remote servers

backend -> combining all components in single module

component == module == application
node == box == server

useradd --system --home /app --shell /sbin/nologin --comment "roboshop system user" roboshop

/home/user-name

frontend

/api/catalogue -> forward those requests to catalogue component
